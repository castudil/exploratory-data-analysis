The function returns the t-statistic and p-value, which can be used to make inferences about the statistical significance of the difference between the means of the two groups. The t-statistic measures the difference between the means in terms of standard errors, and the p-value indicates the probability of obtaining a result as extreme as the observed result, assuming the null hypothesis (no difference between group means) is true.\n",

There are other types of t-tests, such as paired t-tests for dependent samples or one-sample t-tests for comparing a sample mean to a known population mean, which may require different approaches in Python."
